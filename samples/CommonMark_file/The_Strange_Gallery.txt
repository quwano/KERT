# The Strange Gallery
## Chapter1
Yesterday, I **decided to** read the [record]{.underline} of a famous traveler. He wrote, "I will lead you to a cave filled with lead and ancient objects." However, I read that some people object to entering it because of a strange curse.
## Chapter2
Today, [I present a **present to** the gallery owner]{.underline}. He lives in a desert where people desert their cars when the wind is too strong. **He likes to [wind]{.underline} his old clock** while watching a live performance. I live for these moments, even when the content of the book makes me feel content.
